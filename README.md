# BigBrother
<h1>Advanced Spigot "Social Spy" plugin</h1>
This plugin is intended for use on Spigot 1.15.2 servers.<br/>
The plugin provides administrators with the ability: <br/>
<ul>
  <li/>To see all private messages (sent through the commands /w, /m, /msg, /whisper, and /r)
  <li/>To see the contents of all written books
  <li/>To see all regular chat messages. HeroChat channels "g," "l," "h," and "t," are supported. More can be added at request.
  <li/>To see all placed signs
</ul>
BigBrother works out of the box, but the configuration file allows you to choose which modules you want to use.<br/>
