# BigBrother
<h1>Advanced Spigot "Social Spy" plugin</h1>
This plugin is intended for use on Spigot 1.15.2 servers.<br/>
The plugin provides administrators with the ability: <br/>
<ul>
  <li/>To see all private messages (sent through the commands /w, /m, /msg, /whisper, and /r)<br/>
  <li/>To see the contents of all written books<br/>
  <li/>To see all regular chat messages (support for HeroChat channels accessed through the command will be added at a later date)<br/>
  <li/>To see all placed signs<br/>
</ul>
BigBrother currently works "out of the box," but a configuration file is planned for the future.<br/>
