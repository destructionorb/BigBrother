# BigBrother
Advanced Spigot "Social Spy" plugin
This plugin is intended for use on Spigot 1.15.2 servers.
The plugin provides administrators with the ability: 
  To see all private messages (sent through the commands /w, /m, /msg, /whisper, and /r)
  To see the contents of all written books
  To see all regular chat messages (support for HeroChat channels will be added at a later date)
  To see all placed signs
BigBrother currently works "out of the box," but a configuration file is planned for the future.
